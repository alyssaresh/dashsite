This is the code for Dash's website. Dash is an audio engineer, producer, pianist, and composer in Philly. This site is meant to help him connect with clients and share his work. 
I first began work on this project in 2022, when I began building it as a Christmas present for my partner. Now that I've completed my bootcamp, I'm excited to return and refactor it. 

## Tech Stack
(so far) HTML, CSS, Git, command line

## Early design concept (2022)

Dash wears many hats, so I could end up with multiple nav options or pages. But I want to see how much info I can put on one page without having to click another link. I also want to lean into the ascii/code elements of the design. 

## Challenges
**3/5/25** hardest thing so far has been setting up github permissions myself from the terminal. also uploading a repo on my local to github (again, from the terminal). Though google was helpful, I got the best results using chat gpt to help troubleshoot.
