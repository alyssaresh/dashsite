This is the code for Dash's website. Dash is an audio engineer, producer, pianist, and composer in Philly. This site is meant to help him connect with clients and share his work. 
I first began work on this project in 2022, when I built it on my own as a Christmas present for my partner. Now that I've completed my bootcamp, I'm excited to return and refactor it (especially after taking Yannick Gregoire's HTML/CSS/JS class). 

## Tech Stack
(so far) HTML, CSS, JS, Git, terminal

## Early design concept (2022)

Dash wears many hats, so I could end up with multiple nav options or pages. But I want to see how much info I can put on one page without having to click another link. I also want to lean into the ascii/code elements of the design. 

## Challenges
**3/5/25:** hardest thing so far has been setting up github permissions myself from the terminal. also uploading a repo on my local to github (again, from the terminal). Though google was helpful, I got the best results using chat gpt to help troubleshoot.<br>
**3/28/25:** Getting the Lightbox to work was tough. I tried a lot of different things, but ran into some issues because of the way I had split my divs up (a full screen pop up was hard). Simplifying what the lightbox actually did helped in the long run. 

# Need to Dos
-make things mobile friendly<br>
-program in more accessibility

## Hope to Dos
-implement this [ASCII library](https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js)<br>
-transfer everything to React

## Notes
**3/28/25:** programming allows me to make a site look exactly the way I want it to, unlike on Figma where I can only draw a rough concept. The process of building step by step and making tiny changes was so inspiring and fun. I love the way things came together at the end and I'm excited to reformat it and eventually rebuild it with React.
